## No Ads Utility Website

- **Version**: 2025.6.26
- **Status**: In Development

You might wanna bookmark this because I made this with the intention of compiling all of my (and my friends') utilities for convenience without ads. I made all the front-end and had some ai agents assist me with its back-end. Don't expect anything great out of the back-end, but if it works--it works.
